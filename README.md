General use: \
Reasoner.py path/to/input.txt\
Single labels can be entered via commandline:\
Reasoner.py -label formulae,of,the,label\
but commandline may not be suited to write modal formulae.

A input file may consist of a arbitrary numer of lines, each containing a set of comma-separated labels (outer brackets of the set are not required).
All symbols of a Formula need to be separated by spaces (this includes brackets). Unicode may be used for Formulae. For the specific accounted for symbols see Input.txt or Parser.py.
